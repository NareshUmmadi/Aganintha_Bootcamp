            As the attention turns towards the approach and landing of CH-3 on the moon, it is the right time to reflect
            on the making of CH-3. The spacecraft is the result of a collaborative effort, involving a vast array of
            experts from nearly all ISRO centres and contributions from external partners. This article aims to shed
            light on these efforts and provide readers with a glimpse of the CH-3 endeavour.

            A spacecraft carries payloads or scientific instruments in space. When it revolves Earth or a celestial
            body, it is referred to as a satellite â€“ an artificial one. CH-3 consists of a lander, designed to gently
            touch down on the moon's surface, and a rover, ready to explore the lunar terrain upon the lander's
            successful landing. To propel the lander and rover towards the moon, CH-3 relies on a propulsion module
            (PM).

        <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
        <p>This handout will help you understand how paragraphs are formed, how to develop stronger paragraphs, and how
            to completely and clearly express your ideas.</p>
        <h1>
            What is a paragraph?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a
            paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.
        </p>
        <h1>
            How do I decide what to put in a paragraph?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first
            decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that
            you are trying to convey to your reader?

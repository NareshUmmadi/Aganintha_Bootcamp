    <h1>Welcome to Our-Responsive Page</h1>
    
    <p>The<code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag with the viewport attribute is used to control the layout and scaling of the
        webpage on different devices, making it mobile-responsive. The <code>width=device-width</code> ensures that the
        page adapts to the width of the device's screen, and <code>initial-scale=1.0</code> sets the initial zoom level.
        This allows for an optimal viewing experience on various screen sizes, from smartphones to tablets, and even
        desktops. By using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element to reference an external CSS stylesheet, we can further
        enhance the styling and layout of our page, ensuring it looks great on all devices.</p>

        <h2>The Seven Layers of the OSI Model</h2>

        <p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model that describes how data is
            communicated over a network. It is divided into seven layers, each of which has a specific function.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Application Layer</h3>
                <p>This layer provides services to end-user applications, such as file transfer, email, and web
                    browsing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Presentation Layer</h3>
                <p>This layer formats data so that it can be understood by the application layer and the transport
                    layer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Session Layer</h3>
                <p>This layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between devices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Transport Layer</h3>
                <p>This layer provides reliable end-to-end communication between devices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>


                <h3>Network Layer</h3>
                <p>This layer routes packets between networks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>


                <h3>Data Link Layer</h3>
                <p>This layer provides reliable communication between devices on the same network.</p>
            </li>
            <li>


                <h3>Physical Layer</h3>
                <p>This layer transmits and receives raw data over a physical medium.</p>
            </li>

        </ul>

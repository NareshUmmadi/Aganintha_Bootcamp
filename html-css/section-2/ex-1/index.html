    <h1>Welcome to the Web Development Bootcamp!</h1>
    <p>Character encodings are essential for displaying text on the web. They define how characters and symbols are
        represented in binary code, making it possible to display text in different scripts and languages. One common
        character encoding is UTF-8, which is a variable-width encoding capable of representing a wide range of
        characters, including those used in English, Arabic, Chinese, and many other languages. Other character
        encodings, such as ISO-8859-1, are specific to certain scripts and may not cover a broad spectrum of languages.
        It's important to choose the right encoding for your content to ensure that text is displayed correctly on the
        web.</p>

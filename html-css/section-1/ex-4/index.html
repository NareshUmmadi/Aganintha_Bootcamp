    <h1>Welcome to the Ancient Scripts Archive!</h1>
    <p>This website is dedicated to showcasing ancient scripts from all over the world. We use a custom charset of
        ISO-8859-8 to ensure that the scripts are displayed correctly.</p>
    <p>ISO-8859-8 is a character encoding that supports a wide range of characters, including those used in Hebrew,
        Arabic, and other Middle Eastern languages. This makes it ideal for a website that is showcasing historical
        scripts from these regions.</p>
    <p>Without using a custom charset, the scripts on this website may be displayed incorrectly or not at all. This is
        because most browsers do not have built-in support for all of the characters used in ancient scripts.</p>
    <p>By using a custom charset, we can ensure that all of the scripts on this website are displayed correctly,
        regardless of the browser that the user is using.</p>

    <h2>Sample Ancient Hebrew Text:</h2>
    <p>אָנֹכִּי יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ</p>

        <strong>Title: </strong> The title is the most important piece of metadata for SEO, as it is the first thing
        that users see in search engine results pages (SERPs). It is important to create a title that is both
        descriptive and relevant to the content of your website. In this example, the title is "Art Haven | Explore a
        World of Creativity". This title is descriptive because it tells users what the website is about (an online art
        gallery) and what they can expect to find on the website (a diverse collection of masterpieces from renowned and
        emerging artists). The title is also relevant because it includes the keyword "art gallery", which is a keyword
        that many users are likely to search for when looking for an online art gallery.

        <strong>Description:</strong> The description is another important piece of metadata for SEO, as it is the
        snippet of text that appears below the title in SERPs. The description should be a concise and informative
        summary of the content of your website. It should be written in a way that is likely to attract users and
        encourage them to click on your website. In this example, the description is "Discover a diverse collection of
        masterpieces from renowned and emerging artists at Art Haven, an online art gallery. Immerse yourself in the
        world of art and explore your creativity today." This description is concise and informative, and it includes
        several keywords that are likely to be relevant to users who are interested in online art galleries, such as
        "masterpieces", "renowned artists", and "emerging artists". The description also includes a call to action,
        encouraging users to "explore your creativity today". This call to action is likely to make users more likely to
        click on the website and learn more about Art Haven.
